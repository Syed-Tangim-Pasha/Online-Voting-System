# Online-Voting-System
Data Structure C Programming Code

In this project, I mainly focused on how data privacy and user privacy are needed for an online voting system. I was using the linked list data structure in the software, so that I can track every user's voting and I did this for society why we should know about any software and that software data privacy before using it.
